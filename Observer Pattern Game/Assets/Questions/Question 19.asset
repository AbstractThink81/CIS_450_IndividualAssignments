  question: Where are your fingers?
  answers:
  - On my hand
  - Your fingers have two long flexors, which are located on the underside of your
    forearm. They insert with tendons to the phalanges of your fingers. The two flexors-the
    deep flexor and the superficial flexor-allow you to bend your fingers. The deep
    flexor attaches to your distal phalanx, and the superficial flexor attaces to
    the middle phalanx.
