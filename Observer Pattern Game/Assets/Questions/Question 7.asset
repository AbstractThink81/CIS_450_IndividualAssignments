  question: If Tom sells Sally 14 apples for $15.23 per apple and then she sells
    half of them at a 35% discount, but one customer is very generous and pays her
    100x the amount she asks for, what can we say about Sally?
  answers:
  - She now has $23.45 and 7 apples
  - She has enough money to buy some more apples from Tom
